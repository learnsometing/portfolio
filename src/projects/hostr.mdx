    <strong>Relational databases</strong> provide a means to relate datasets to each other through
    foreign key associations. Under the hood, <strong>Rails</strong> uses the <strong>ActiveRecord ORM</strong> to
    implement database relations through ActiveRecord associations.

    <strong>Hostr</strong> is an <strong>eventbrite</strong> inspired app that was 
    developed to practice using ActiveRecord associations. Users can sign up with 
    their name, create events, and invite other users to their own events. All 
    previous and upcoming events can be browsed as well.
