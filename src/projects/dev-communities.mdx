Dev Communities is my final project in the Odin Project Ruby on Rails curriculum.
It was inspired by Facebook, Meetup, and Stack Overflow. I wanted Dev Communities
to enable developers to discover each other and form communities they could engage
in. In the end, I had to cut some of the features to have the app in a working
state in time for it to be presented to my local development community, so it
resembles Facebook more than anything. I struggled the most with developing
a notifications system for the application, but I thouroughly enjoyed
modeling the data relationships that power its main features.
