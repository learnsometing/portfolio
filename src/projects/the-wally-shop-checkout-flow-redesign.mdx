    While preparing to secure more orders on a monthly basis, the store's
    checkout flow was identified as a barrier to conversion and order
    processing. The first page in the process was dedicated to selling
    additional products, but was overwhelming to use. The checkout page lacked
    useful error handling, so our customers weren't being given any reasons why
    their orders wouldn't go through. Lastly, our team felt that condensing all
    of the checkout steps on one page was overwhelming to our customers. It was
    also unsightly, due to layout shift caused by interacting with features on
    the page.
  </Typography>
  <Typography className="description fade-in" gutterBottom>
    To make the first page of the checkout flow less overwhelming, the number of
    additional products shown to the user was limited to a maximum of twelve.
    The products were also reorganized into a carousel to make room to show the
    customer's cart below. A call to action with a helpful tone was used to
    remind the customer to check for any forgotten or previously unviewed items.
    Lastly, Google Analytics event tracking was added to each product in the
    carousel to measure conversion when added to the cart. These changes reduced
    the likelihood of overwhelming our customers when they decide to add
    additional items to their cart and gave them another opportunity to review
    their cart before checking out.
  </Typography>

    To reduce the complexity and the layout shift on the checkout page, it was
    split into three separate pages. The first two pages were dedicated to
    shipping and payment, and the last page was dedicated to order review. A
    single column on each page allowed collapsible elements to continue to be
    used while reducing the awkwardness of the resulting layout shift. To
    further reduce layout shift and bundle size, shipping and payment forms were
    made into modals that could be lazy-loaded with React's Suspense package.
    Cookies were also leveraged to save customer-selected preferences to prevent
    completed parts of the checkout process from being reset.
  </Typography>
  <Typography className="description fade-in" gutterBottom>
    Error handling was improved throughout the process by enforcing form-level
    and API-level data validation and sanitization on address, payment, and
    order submission forms. This change prevented erroneous data from ever
    reaching our database and also allowed us to display helpful messages to
    guide the customer through error resolution.
