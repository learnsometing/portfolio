The web relies on JavaScript to add rich, dynamic features that aren't otherwise
possible with HTML and CSS alone. This project was an exercise in using JavaScript
to perform calculations on user input. It tokenizes the user input then leverages
the shunting-yard algorithm to perform order of operations. It was challenging
to decide how to track changes to the user input and to perform the calculations
in the correct order. After completing the project on my own, I learned about
JavaScript's eval() function, which could have been used instead of the
shunting-yard algorithm.
