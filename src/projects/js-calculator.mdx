    The web relies on JavaScript to add rich, dynamic features that aren't otherwise
    possible with HTML and CSS alone. This project was an exercise in using <strong>JavaScript</strong>
    to perform calculations on user input.

    It tokenizes the user input then leverages the <strong>shunting-yard algorithm</strong> to perform
    order of operations. It was challenging to decide how to track changes to the user input 
    and to perform the calculations in the correct order.

    After completing the project on my own, I learned about
    JavaScript's eval() function, which could have been used instead of the
    shunting-yard algorithm.
