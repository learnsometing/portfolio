Data-driven applications rely on APIs to retrieve and mutate data in a convenient
and efficient manner. Making asynchronous calls to third-party APIs can be tricky
though. I built this project to practice both asynchronous JavaScript and using
fetch to make REST API calls. It displays the current forecast for the area
the user chooses to search. I chose to build it using React instead of vanilla
JS for more React practice also.
