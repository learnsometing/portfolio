Forms are used on even the simplest websites to gather information from the user.
This app was an exercise in building forms in Ruby on Rails. Users pick their
desired departure and arrival destinations and enter the number of passengers,
then pick the desired flight, and finally enter information on each passenger.
Rails provides convenient methods to associate form fields with model fields
that simplify submitting user data to the database.
