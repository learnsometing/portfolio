    It's necessary for all web developers to have a solid grasp on responsive design.
    To develop and apply my understanding of <strong>responsive design principles</strong>, I mocked
    the home page of The Next Web's website.

    I constructed the webpage first using <strong>HTML</strong>,
    studied how The Next Web's website responded to changes in the viewport width, and
    finally used <strong>CSS media queries</strong> and <strong>flexbox</strong> to implement the responsive behaviors.
