It's necessary for all web developers to have a solid grasp on responsive design.
To develop and apply my understanding of responsive design principles, I mocked
the home page of The Next Web's website. I constructed the webpage first using HTML,
studied how The Next Web's website responded to changes in the viewport width, and
finally used CSS media queries and flexbox to implement the responsive behaviors.
