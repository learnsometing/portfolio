<Typography variant={'body1'} gutterBottom>
  I developed veropawn.net independently for Cash Pawn & Jewelry, a pawn shop
  located in Vero Beach, FL. The website is a <strong>React</strong> web
  application built on the
  <strong>Gatsby</strong> static site generator framework. During this project, I
  employed responsive and UX friendly designs to implement an online catalog of the
  shop’s inventory. My main challenge while building this website was my experience
  level; I had no prior <strong>React</strong> or <strong>Gatsby</strong> experience
  at the beginning of this project and learned both frameworks during development.
  It was also challenging to retrieve and process the shop’s inventory data. I used
  the shop’s inventory data to programmatically build thousands of shopping pages
  and item pages and dynamically generate navigation. The resulting website increased
  overall sales and customer satisfaction and bolstered the company’s limited web
  presence.
