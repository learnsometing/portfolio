    I developed veropawn.net independently for Cash Pawn & Jewelry, a pawn shop
    located in Vero Beach, FL. The website is a <strong>React</strong> app built with 
    <strong> Gatsby</strong>, a popular static site generator framework. The resulting 
    website increased sales and customer satisfaction and bolstered the company’s limited web presence.

    This app serves as an inventory catalog and features responsive and UX friendly designs.
    Its dynamically generated navigation and the thousands of programmatically created 
    shopping and product pages highlight the marriage of React and server-side rendering,
    which is handled by Gatsby under the hood. The shop’s inventory data fuels
    the creation of these features at build time.

    Building this website at my level of experience was challenging, because I had 
    no prior <strong>React</strong> or <strong>Gatsby</strong> experience to start with.
    I learned both frameworks during development and learned about testing React applications
    along the way.
