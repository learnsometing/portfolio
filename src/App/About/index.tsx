              In January 2019 I left my career in the wine industry to pursue a
              more satisfying career in web development. In the past year,
              I&#39;ve immersed myself in web technologies and grown my
              appreciation for the richness and complexities of the sites that
              connect us.

              className="about scroll-in"
            >
              My interest in frontend development was ignited by the realization
              that I had an opportunity to create things that could be used by
              millions of people every day. Now driven by the desire to
              implement elegant and effective websites, I spend my time
              developing React applications and practicing design with a focus
              on user experience.

              The rest of my free time is spent gardening, cooking, eating, and
              drinking with my partner Arden and our pets Herbie ü¶ú and Skipper
              üêï. We recently moved to Beacon, NY where (hopefully soon) we can
              be found in the community garden, or at one of the many coffee
              shops and breweries in town.
