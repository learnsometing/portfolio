    "fullDescription": "I developed veropawn.net independently for Cash Pawn & Jewelry, a pawn shop located in Vero Beach, FL. The website is a React web application built on the Gatsby static site generator framework. During this project, I employed responsive and UX friendly designs to implement an online catalog of the shop’s inventory. My main challenge while building this website was my experience level; I had no prior React or Gatsby experience at the beginning of this project and learned both frameworks during development. It was also challenging to retrieve and process the shop’s inventory data I used the shop’s inventory data to programmatically build thousands of shopping pages and item pages and dynamically generate navigation. The resulting website increased overall sales and customer satisfaction and bolstered the company’s limited web presence.",
